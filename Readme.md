## RadioML Dataset
Dataset: RML2016.10a.tar.bz2
Source of Dataset: https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets
- All modulation schemes and SNRs of the RadioML dataset are considered for training and testing.

## Data
- RadioML dataset is split into training and validation datasets with 20% of data for validation.
- Both training and validation dataset contains samples from all modulation schemes for all SNRs.

## Architectures
- AutoML Customised ResNet, AutoML Customised CLDNN, AutoML Customised CNN and AutoML Customised RNN.

## Training and Testing
- Models are trained and evaluated on training and validation datasets respectively.
- Performance is also validated on ResNet, CLDNN and Robust-CNN models from [Improvements to Modulation Classification Techniques using Deep Learning](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/projects/Report/76Report.pdf).

## Adversarial-Attacks
Transfer-Based Untargeted Adversarial Attacks are performed on AutoML Models.
### PGD-Attack
- Projected Gradient Descent(PGD) technique is used to generate adversarial samples using a surrogate model **Robust-CNN** from [Improvements to Modulation Classification Techniques using Deep Learning](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/projects/Report/76Report.pdf).

### CW-Attack
- Carlini and Wagner(CW) technique is used to generate adversarial samples using a surrogate model **Robust-CNN** from [Improvements to Modulation Classification Techniques using Deep Learning](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/projects/Report/76Report.pdf).
